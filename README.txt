Hello!

Thnaks for visiting!
Please see examples of proof that I can build predictive models using a variety of methods to respond to business questions.

SQL DATA WRANGLING
	see query.sql for a sample of a complex CTE data lakehouse query
	
PYTHON DATA SCIENCE ANALYTICS

Linear Regression
	Classical Statistics
	Transparent, interpretable, visible components
	Use case - understanding interworkings of a business questions
	e.g. fixing an old car; you can get in there, replace parts, test, and see how components interact
	
RandomForestRegressor
	Modern Machine Learning
	Understandable and explainable, but a bit more "black box" on what choices were made by the algorithm and why
	Use Case - incredible accurate and effective prediction outcomes
	e.g. fixing a new car; tuning and reprogramming internal computers goes a longer way than looking in detail under the hood
